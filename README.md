# save-driven-development
Automated software engineering workflow based on gitnotify and the feature-branch git workflow. 
Save driven development (sdd) automates the commit creation and push process using current branch and file context.
Individual commit creation on every file update can very quickly lead to a very large number of commits in the history, typically more than can be reasonably kept track of.
For this reason, the sdd workflow emphasizes heavy usage of `tags`.

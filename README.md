# save-driven-development
Automated software engineering workflow based on gitnotify and the feature-branch git workflow. 
Save driven development (sdd) automates the commit creation and push process using current branch (using the feature-branch model) and file context.
Individual commit creation on every file update can very quickly lead to a very large number of commits in the history, typically more than can be reasonably kept track of.
For this reason, the sdd workflow emphasizes heavy usage of `tags`.
